Hi, I'm Matheus Zalamena de Lima, a software engineer with a background in data, focused on operational and business efficiency. I have experience in software development and data analysis, where I work on creating end-to-end pipelines, and I'm currently responsible for the data lifecycle of the company where I work. My knowledge covers data visualization and manipulation tools, as well as databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Power BI, Databricks and Denodo, as well as programming languages such as Python). I firmly believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning. I'm always open to new challenges and love exchanging experiences with other professionals in the field.
